# CS-360-Inventory-App
Final mobile app project for CS 360

For this project, I developed an Inventory App designed to help users easily manage and track items with features like login, low-stock SMS alerts, and add/edit/delete item capabilities. The primary user need it addressed was organization—allowing users to quickly update or check stock levels on the go. I designed screens like a login page, an inventory grid, and an item detail page with user-centered layouts that focused on clarity and ease of use. I kept users in mind by using large buttons, simple input forms, and conditional logic to enable notifications only when items were running low, avoiding unnecessary alerts.

My UI designs were successful because I reviewed other inventory apps to get ideas on best practices and what frustrated me as a user. I also used Android Studio’s Material3 guidelines and discovered the design view, which let me drag and drop UI components while seeing how they connected to the XML. That discovery really changed my development flow—it helped me align my frontend and backend logic better and gave me more control over layout behavior.

When it came to coding, I took a modular approach. I created helper classes like DatabaseHelper to manage SQLite database logic, separating concerns and keeping my code organized. I used resources like ChatGPT, developer documentation, and community forums to troubleshoot problems as they came up. To test functionality, I ran my app on the emulator and on a physical device, checking how features like login, SMS permissions, and item updates worked across different API levels—especially since my app was targeting API 36. Testing helped me catch logic errors and refine the user flow.

The biggest challenge I faced was figuring out how to make the app user-friendly while still meeting all the technical requirements. I had to innovate by integrating the SMS notification system in a way that worked even if the user denied permission, ensuring the app didn’t crash. I was particularly proud of how I combined UI interaction and backend logic, especially in managing user sessions and item updates smoothly. Overall, this project helped me grow in both Android development and full-stack thinking, and I now feel more confident in building apps that not only function well but are also intuitive for users.
