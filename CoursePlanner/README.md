# C++ University Course Planner

**Category:** Algorithms and Data Structures  
**Course:** CS-300 Data Structures and Algorithms  

This project reads course data from a CSV file and organizes it into a searchable course catalog.  
It demonstrates the use of data structures such as `unordered_map` and `vector` to efficiently store and retrieve course information.

## Enhancements
Enhancements made for this capstone include:
- Improved CSV parsing with input validation
- Normalized course numbers (case-insensitive lookups)
- Added error handling for malformed input and missing files
- Updated repository structure and documentation

---

## Reflection
Through these improvements, I demonstrated proficiency in algorithmic design and robust data handling.  
I also incorporated security considerations by validating user input and preventing runtime errors.
